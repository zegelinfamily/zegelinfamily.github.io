The island has a fascinating history going back to prehistory and just about everyone has invaded at one time or another, so there was a great mix of Greek temples, Roman villas, Norman castles and Spanish and Italian palaces. Earthquakes in the late 1600s wiped out many towns in the south and the palaces and public buildings were rebuilt from the local sandstone in a very harmonious Baroque style that we found was much nicer than the European Baroque.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2024_Victoria_And_South_Australia</guid><title>Victoria and South Australia</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2024_Victoria_And_South_Australia</link><description><![CDATA[Just a quick trip to Adelaide and Kinglake to visit family. On the way we stopped at the Barossa Valley and visited the wonderful Dali exhibition at the D’Arenberg Winery in McLaren Vale. We also spent a few days at Halls Gap in the Grampians, visiting the beautiful waterfalls and lookouts in the area.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2024_Fiji</guid><title>Fiji - Nanuku Beach Resort</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2024_Fiji</link><description><![CDATA[A wonderful and relaxing short holiday spent at the beautiful Nanuku Resort with family and grandkids, mainly lazing around the pool and walking along the beach. The resort setting was wonderful and the food and staff exceptional. It was nice that we could fly directly to Nadi from Canberra.]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2023_Florida,_Georgia_And_South_Carolina</guid><title>Florida, Georgia and South Carolina</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2023_Florida,_Georgia_And_South_Carolina</link><description><![CDATA[Another great US trip. This time we spent nearly a week at Miami Beach admiring the beautiful art deco hotels that lined the main street and visiting some famous landmarks in the area. We also had a fun day at Key West and saw some aligators at the Everglades National Park. Then an interesting drive up the west coast of Florida visiting the Edision workshops and Ford and Edison homes, the Ringling Circus Museum, the Dali Museum and Chihuli Gallery at St. Petersberg and the Tiffany Museum near Orlando. Then it was up to beautiful Charleston, Beaufort, Savanna and Fernandina Beach. In between we managed to see two SpaceX rockets take off, one of which was nearly a double in one night, which would have been a first, but the second flight was cancelled at the last 30 seconds. We did manage to see another take off a few weeks later on the way back to Miami for our trip home.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2019_Italy</guid><title>Northern Italy</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2019_Italy</link><description><![CDATA[We got invited to a wedding in Italy so we made the most of it, this time concentrating on the northern part of the country. After spending some time in Milan we headed to Montagnana, a beautiful medieval walled town, where we managed to see their annual Palio with medieval parades and bare back horse races. In Verona we saw an opera in the ancient Roman amphitheatre and drove around Lake Garda. After that we visited the interesting cities of Bologna and Parma, eating fantastic food along the way. Then a week visiting the interesting towns of the Cinque Terre as well as nearby Lucca, then home. Through the whole trip the weather was great and the food to die for.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2018_Mount_Rushmore_And_Yellowstone_NP</guid><title>Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone NP</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2018_Mount_Rushmore_And_Yellowstone_NP</link><description><![CDATA[An interesting trip marred by us both having bad colds, or worse. Still managed to see what we came for. Highlights were a helicopter ride over Mount Rushmore and surrounds, the Needles highway, a visit to the Badlands National Park and the Mammoth Site at Hot Springs.  After a long drive to beautiful Red Lodge, visiting Devils Tower on the way, we took a breathtaking drive over the Beartooth Highway, the highest highway in North America, to Yellowstone National Park. This was our second visit to the park and it didn’t disappoint, with some of the geysers being extra active and a bear appearing near the side of the road.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2017_Greece</guid><title>Greece</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2017_Greece</link><description><![CDATA[This was a wonderful trip with so much history to take in. We stuck to the mainland this time, first visiting Athens then staying for a week each at 2 different locations in the Peloponnese, visiting the ancient sites in the area. This was followed by a road trip to visit the fantastic Vikos Gorge, Ioannina, Meteora and Royal Tombs of Philip II and family at Vergina. Then a relaxing week in a mountainous village near Volos. The village had the most dangerous ‘road’ to get to it you’ll ever see, including driving 200 meters along a light rail track with cliff on one side, through a rail tunnel, with a bend in it, to the village! Fortunately the train only came a few times a day and went fairly slowly, but after doing it a few times we decided to park the car at the bottom of the mountain and walk up and down. After that, another road trip to Delphi and surrounds. Only downside was we had 900 photos to sort through when we got back.]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2016_New_Zealand</guid><title>New Zealand</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2016_New_Zealand</link><description><![CDATA[On the spur of the moment we decided to take advantage of a - short lived - direct flight from Canberra to Wellington. Our main goal was to visit the beautiful Art Deco town of Napier and the surrounding wineries of Hawke’s Bay. After that we drove around the northern coast on to Rotorua and then down to Mount Egmont for a wonderful few days visiting several spectacular gardens in the area.]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2016_Scotland</guid><title>Scotland</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2016_Scotland</link><description><![CDATA[We had hoped to visit Scotland as part of our trip through the UK nearly 30 years ago but we completely ran out of time on that trip, so it was great to finally get here. As with Ireland we were really lucky with the weather, with sunshine and blue skies almost every day. After a great week in Edinburgh we left for the countryside, visiting lots of castles, old stately homes, ancient burial sites, battlegrounds and churches as well as some beautiful gardens. The scenery, especially in the Western Highlands and Skye, was fantastic. Stayed mostly in B&B’s along the way. In places they got pretty scarce and we had a few close calls, with sleeping in the car becoming an option. Thankfully that never happened.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2015_Margaret_River</guid><title>WA - Fremantle and Margaret River</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2015_Margaret_River</link><description><![CDATA[This was just a short trip to visit Perth, Fremantle and the Margaret River area. The botanical gradens in Perth were lovely and there were some interesting historical parts of Fremantle as well. We then moved on to our airbnb at Prevelly, on the beach, which was a great base for visiting the whole Margaret River area. We visited wineries, some very interesting and beautiful cave systems, and took tours of two historic lighthouses. Both lighthouses are located at the most western part of Australia and were very scenic. At Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse we managed to see lots of whales passing by, spouting water in the distance.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2015_New_York_And_New_England</guid><title>New York and New England</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2015_New_York_And_New_England</link><description><![CDATA[Lots of interesting things to see and do on this trip. In New York we spent some time visiting the art deco skyscrapers, a trip to the top of the Empire State building and a fascinating tour of Grand Central Station. In New Canaan we visited the Philip Johnson Glass House. We saw Yale and Harvard, visited Mark Twain’s beautiful family home, and spent a few days in Rhode island visiting the guilded mansions of the rich and famous. In Barre we visited a huge granite quarry that makes tombstones and in Burlington we went on a tour and bought a teddy bear from the famous Vermont Teddy Bear factory. The factory even has it’s own hospital for damaged bears! After that it was historic houses and towns until we got to the spectacular Niagra Falls. We walked across the border to Canada to see the falls from a different vantage point as well. A visit to the fabulous Corning Glass Museum and Bethel Woods where Woodstock was held all those years ago rounded out a great trip.]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2014_Italy</guid><title>Central Italy</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2014_Italy</link><description><![CDATA[On this trip we decided to stick to Central Italy and thoroughly explore the area. After spending a wonderful week in Rome we headed out to the countryside staying in 3 airbnb’s for over a week each. Highlights were visiting Hadrians Villa, Tarquinia and Ostia Antica and the beautiful hill town of Montone where we spent many day trips to other beautiful and interesting towns in the area. The towns around Lake Bolsena were also very interesting. We also managed to see a stage of the Giro d’Italia and even drove down a several kilometer section of the Appian Way, though we weren’t sure if we were allowed to.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2013_Phuket</guid><title>Phuket and Malacca</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2013_Phuket</link><description><![CDATA[We’d enjoyed our previous stay at Phuket so much that we decided to do the same thing the next year. We had a different villa in the complex this time but it was still excellent with a private pool and all. We spent much of the month relaxing and going ‘local’. It did rain quite a bit more this time but we still managed to spend a lot of time out and about and eating at lots of excellent restaurants. At the end of our trip we spent a few days in the old Malaysian trading port of Malacca which we had last visited 30 years before.]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2013_New_Mexico_And_Arizona</guid><title>New Mexico and Arizona</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2013_New_Mexico_And_Arizona</link><description><![CDATA[This trip had been on our bucket list for quite a while and it didn’t disappoint. The variety of places we visited made every day fascinating. Everything from Titan missile silos to petrified forests, huge meteor craters, gigantic caves at Carlsbad, the ancient Indian settlements at Mesa Verde and the beautiful Canyon de Chelly and Grand Canyon, as well as the interesting old towns of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Los Alamos and the whole Trinity thing was also very interesting as was the National Solar Observatory, the Very Large Array, and Lowell observatory at Flagstaff, where they discovered Pluto.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2012_Phuket</guid><title>Sri Lanka and Phuket</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2012_Phuket</link><description><![CDATA[We started off in Sri Lanka by visiting many of the ancient temple complexes in the northern part of the island that we had missed the last time we were there. That trip was cut short by the outbreak of a Civil War and unfortunately this meant that this time much of the infrastructure was still in a shambles. It was still quite interesting but 10 days was enough. This was followed by a wonderfully relaxing 1 month stay at a beautiful villa on Phuket. It was the rainy season so the villa was amazingly good value and we were lucky that it only rained on a few days. We had a car for the whole month so spent quite a few days touring the islands various beaches and checking out some new villas for sale, pretending to be potential buyers.]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2012_Ireland</guid><title>Ireland</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2012_Ireland</link><description><![CDATA[Our trip to Ireland didn’t disappoint. Apart from a few days here and there, we got really lucky with the weather with beautiful blue skies and sunshine. Dublin was fun, with a great live music scene and buskers everywhere, and the countryside was as green as you can imagine. Some of the highlights were the spectacular cliffs of Moher and Slieve League, the Dingle Peninsula and the Giants Causeway. The scenery was beautiful everywhere we drove and there were plenty of old monasteries, castles and ancient burial sites to visit. One memorable drive was over Conor Pass, a narrow single lane road to Dingle with great views all around and challenging occasional oncoming traffic. Near the pass itself there were pullouts and drivers used their headlights to signal when it was their turn to drive the few hundred meters to the next pullout.]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 05 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2011_West_Coast_USA</guid><title>West Coast USA</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2011_West_Coast_USA</link><description><![CDATA[All our trips to the US have been really interesting and this one was no exception. Virtually every day there was something different to see, from the majestic redwood forests and coastline of Northern California to Mount St. Helens, Portland and the waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge, Seattle and the Boeing Factory, the mile wide Grand Coulee Dam and of course Yellowstone National Park and the Tetons. The drive through Montana was epic, with a beautifully maintained 3+3 lane highway, no traffic at all, and the majestic scenery unfolding in front of us. There were also some fun surprises like the unusual houses in Eureka and the remnants of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion experiment at EBR-1. A really great trip.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2010_Vietnam</guid><title>Darwin and Vietnam</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2010_Vietnam</link><description><![CDATA[We took advantage of a relatively cheap airfare to visit Vietnam, with a 3 day stopover in Darwin. There were quite a few interesting things to do in Darwin so it was worth the stopover. Vietnam was great. We spent a few days in Saigon visiting the sights and enjoying the food. We also went on a 3 day bicycle tour around the Mekong River area which was fun. We were by far the oldest on the tour but managed to keep up just fine and the youngies were fascinated hearing about our travel exploits. We then spent a really nice week relaxing at a hotel resort on the coast, taking a few day trips to the local sights and enjoying the wonderful food.]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2010_Tasmania</guid><title>Tasmania</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2010_Tasmania</link><description><![CDATA[]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2008_Cambodia</guid><title>Cambodia and Thailand</title><link>https://www.zegelin.com/peter/trips/2008_Cambodia</link><description><![CDATA[This was just a quick trip mainly to visit Ankor Wat in Cambodia. We spent 3 days following in the footsteps of Lara Croft as we explored the temple ruins during the day, followed by eating and drinking at some of the wonderful restaurants along the main food street of Siem Reap. We then had a relaxing two week holiday on the island of Phuket, staying at a luxury resort. This was our first time back to Phuket since our big trip trough Asia in 1983 and it had changed dramatically. The quiet and isolated beach where we had stayed all those years ago was now a bustling town with many hotels and resorts. It was still fun though, our resort was beautiful and there were plenty of great restaurants nearby.]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
