          <p> The Margarita has suffered terribly in modern times. In an effort to make it hip, quick, trendy and cheap it has been bastardized far worse then any cocktail before it. Whether it is the use of inferior (or just plain wrong) ingredients, or commercially made mixes, the common Margarita these days tastes more like a ‘Limeade’ with a splash of orange juice than it does the delectable cocktail that it once was.</p>
          <p>A true Margarita is made from three ingredients: Tequila, Cointreau (Triple Sec) and fresh squeezed lime juice. Like any cocktail, the true art comes in arriving at the proper ratio of the ingredients in order to present a balance of the flavours. Arguably the best ratio for a Margarita is 3:2:1. Three parts Tequila, 2 parts Cointreau and 1 part freshly squeezed lime juice.</p>
